A PASSWORD ANALYZER SYSTEM
This system allows the user to enter the password then 
Analyze password strength and suggest improvements using multiple criteria.
It is also able to detect the strength of your password.
There are some common passwords already stored in the system and if the 
user enter any of them it will ask the user to enter another password again
to increase security of the pasword.

 FUNCTIONALITIES
 1.  Check passwords against these criteria:
   - Length (minimum 8 characters)
   - Contains uppercase letters
   - Contains lowercase letters
   - Contains numbers
   - Contains special characters (!@#$%^&*)
   - Not a common password (maintain list of 20+ common passwords)
2. Scoring system: Each criterion = 20 points (max 120 points)
3. Strength levels: Weak(0-40), Fair(41-60), Good(61-80), Strong(81-100), Excellent(101-120)
4. Generate specific improvement suggestions

And while your password is weak, it keeps asking you for the password and
guiding you to make it strong.
